Protobile
=========

A PHP framework that works. 

Another framework? Why?
-----------------------
Protobile is a PHP framework being designed for massive enterprise use, ease of development and deployment, speed security. Protobile is a open source counterpart of Morgana Enterprise framework created by Marolind for closed source enterprise projects. 

### MVP concept of the Protobile

- Single step installation: as soon as code is on the machine, it should not require more than one step to get the framework running. Everything that can be automated, must be automated;
- Code generators: creating common components must be automated;
- Automation friendly: framework should be as easy to manage, deploy and otherwise manipulate as possible;
- Minimum overhead: services must operate on-demand except for essential services;
- ... TBD.

### Status of the project
Protobile is currently being developed as a concept. Do not expect it to be production ready any time soon.

"Barcelona" is code name of the current development version of the Protobile.
